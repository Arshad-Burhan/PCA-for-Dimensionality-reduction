## Machine Learning (Coursera) by Andrew NG

## Project: K-means for Image compression

### Project Overview

In this exercise, I used principal component analysis (PCA) to perform dimensionality reduction. We will first experiment with an example 2D dataset to get intuition on how PCA works, and then will run PCA on bigger dataset of 5000 face image dataset to see how it can be used in practice for dimension reduction.
